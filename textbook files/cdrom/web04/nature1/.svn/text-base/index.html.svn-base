          <p>Many Companies that talk about Customer Service fail to
          deliver. Nature's Source exists to truly serve all the needs of
          their customers. Each location features dedicated on-site
          therapists along with knowledgeable staff who ensure that every
          customer receives the best quality information available.
          Continuing Education seminars are a regular event at Nature's
