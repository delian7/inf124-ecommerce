    <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is used as an indicator of total body fat.</p>
    <form id="bmiForm" action="">
    </form>
    <p>Total body fat is correlated to the risk of certain diseases which can
    be potentially fatal. BMI is valid for both men and women. However, it
    should only be used as a guideline as it has some limitations. It may
    overestimate the body fat in muscular persons and underestimate the body
    fat in persons who have lost muscle mass.</p>
    <p>More information can be found at the <a
    href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm">National Institute of
    Health</a> website. This Calculator is based on the formula obtained from
    the above site.</p>
